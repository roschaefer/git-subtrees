# The "last synced commit"

`status`, `pull` and `push` all need to answer "what changed since this
subtree and its remote were last the same?". This page defines that point,
shows how it moves, and lists what it can't tell you.

Run the walkthrough to watch it happen in a scratch repo:

    docs/last-synced-commit/walkthrough.sh

Every state quoted below is what that script prints. `test/walkthrough.bats`
runs it, so this page can't drift from the code.

## Why it exists

`git subtree pull --squash` never makes the remote's commits ancestors of
your `HEAD`, so `git merge-base HEAD <remote>/<branch>` finds nothing. The
tool needs another anchor: a point in *your* history where `vendor/a` was
known to equal a specific upstream commit.

## Definition

Two commits, both found by looking backwards from `HEAD`
(`find_sync_commit` and `sync_split_sha` in `lib/common.sh`):

| Name | What it is | How it's found |
|---|---|---|
| **S**, the last synced commit | The squash commit `git subtree add`/`pull --squash` created. Its tree is exactly U's content, with no `vendor/a/` prefix. | Newest commit reachable from `HEAD` carrying a `git-subtree-dir: vendor/a` trailer. |
| **U**, the upstream commit taken | The remote commit whose content S recorded. | The `git-subtree-split: <sha>` trailer on S. |

```
                        U   (upstream commit, e.g. its main at the time)
                        │
   monorepo history:    S   "Squashed 'vendor/a/' content from commit U"
                         ╲   trailers: git-subtree-dir: vendor/a
                          ╲            git-subtree-split: U
   ── … ──────────────────── o ─────── a ─────── b ─────── HEAD
                            merge of S            local commits
                                                  under vendor/a
```

## How the state is decided

First the cheap checks. If `vendor/a` equals the remote branch's content:
`up-to-date`. If `vendor/a` still equals S's tree, nothing changed locally,
so the remote moved: `pull` (or `unrelated-history` if the remote shares
no history with U).

Otherwise, `git subtree split` answers who is ahead. It rebuilds
`vendor/a`'s history as the commits a push would send, mapping S to U.
split is deterministic, so for commits you already pushed, it rebuilds
exactly the commits the remote has. The tool splits `HEAD` and compares
the result, H, with the remote branch's tip R by ancestry:

| | State |
|---|---|
| H = R, or equal content | `up-to-date` |
| R is an ancestor of H | `push` -- it fast-forwards the remote |
| H is an ancestor of R | `pull` |
| a common ancestor, but neither contains the other | `diverged` |
| no common ancestor | `unrelated-history` |

Without S there's nothing to split from: `unrelated-history`. If U isn't
available locally, split can't run either: `diverged`, so that `pull` gets
to fetch U.

split walks every commit reachable from `HEAD`, a few milliseconds each,
whether or not it touches `vendor/a`. S gives it a mapping but doesn't let
it skip history; only a `git subtree split --rejoin` merge would. So
`status` gets slower as the monorepo grows, for each subtree with local
changes it hasn't pushed. `find_sync_commit` skips merges, so a `--rejoin`
merge, carrying the same trailers as S, is never taken for S.

## Properties worth knowing

1. **It lives in your history, not on the remote.** It exists whether or
   not the remote has a branch named like yours. But a missing remote
   branch takes away what to compare *with*, and the sync point can't
   replace that -- see the next section.
2. **It follows `HEAD`, not the branch name.** A branch cut from `main`
   inherits `main`'s sync point. Merging another branch in brings that
   branch's sync points along. Nothing compares `feature-1` to `feature-2`.
3. **Only `add` and `pull` move it.** Each writes a new squash commit.
   A push doesn't need to: split rebuilds the pushed commits, so the
   remote holding your own push reads as `push` or `up-to-date`, not as a
   remote change.
4. **It must come from a squash.** A plain `git subtree add` (no
   `--squash`) makes the sync commit itself the merge, so its tree is the
   whole monorepo rather than U's content.

## When the remote has no branch like yours

The sync point says what `vendor/a` looked like when it last matched
upstream. It can't say whether *this branch* changed anything, because it
is inherited from whatever branch you cut from and never moves on `push`.
So when the remote has no branch named like yours, the tool doesn't use it.
It compares inside the monorepo instead, with the **base branch**:

```
git diff $(git merge-base <base> HEAD) HEAD -- vendor/a
```

- **No difference:** the subtree is untouched on this branch. `push` skips
  it.
- **A difference:** the subtree changed on this branch. `push` creates the
  remote branch.

Using the merge base means changes that land on the base branch after you
cut yours don't count against you, and changes that were already on the base
branch when you cut it aren't yours either. Nothing on the remote is
consulted, and nothing depends on S or U, so it works the same for
subtrees added without `--squash` or adopted by plain commits.

Git doesn't record which branch you cut from. The base branch is `--base
<branch>` if given, else the target of `origin/HEAD`, else
`init.defaultBranch`; a candidate must exist and share history with `HEAD`.
If nothing resolves, the command asks for `--base` rather than guess. On the
base branch itself there is nothing to compare, and `push` creates the
missing branch.

Once the remote has the branch (for instance after `push` created it), this
case no longer applies: the normal same-name classification takes over.

## Walkthrough

Each row is one step of `walkthrough.sh`. "State" is what the tool
reports for the current branch.

| # | Step | Sync point | State | Why |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `subtree add --squash` on `main` | S1 created | `up-to-date` | Local equals remote `main`. |
| 2 | Cut `feature-1`; remote has no such branch | S1 (inherited) | `missing-at-head`, **unchanged** vs base `main` | Nothing under `vendor/a` differs from the merge base with `main`, so `push` skips it. |
| 3 | Commit a change under `vendor/a` | S1 | `missing-at-head`, **changed** vs base `main` | `vendor/a` differs from the merge base, so `push` would create `feature-1`. |
| 4 | `subtree push` creates remote `feature-1` | S1 (unchanged) | `up-to-date` | The remote branch exists now, so the same-name comparison applies, and it equals local. Note the sync point did not move. |
| 5 | Another branch changes `vendor/a` too; merge it into `feature-1` | S1 | `push` | Splitting `HEAD` rebuilds the commit pushed in step 4, so remote `feature-1` is an ancestor of H. Pushing fast-forwards it. |
| 6 | Remote `feature-1` is deleted | S1 | `missing-at-head`, **changed** vs base `main` | Back to the base-branch case: `feature-1` still differs from `main`. |
| 7 | Upstream `main` moves; `git subtrees pull` on `main` | **S2** | `up-to-date` | `pull` wrote a new squash commit, so the sync point advanced. |
| 8 | Merge `main` into `feature-1` | S2 (inherited) | `missing-at-head`, **changed** vs base `main` | The merge brought S2 in. `feature-1` still has changes relative to the merge base with `main`. |

The walkthrough sets `init.defaultBranch` in its scratch repo, which is how
the base branch is found there.

## Known limitations

1. **A push rewritten on the way isn't recognised.** If the pushed
   commits were changed, e.g. with `git subtree push --annotate`, or
   rebased on the remote, split doesn't rebuild them, and further local
   changes look `diverged`. That's accurate: a push wouldn't fast-forward.
2. **The base branch has to be findable.** With no `origin/HEAD`, no
   `init.defaultBranch` and no `--base`, `push` refuses on a branch the
   remote lacks. A monorepo whose own remote isn't called `origin` gets no
   help from `origin/HEAD`.
3. **A new remote branch isn't checked against the remote's history.**
   When `push` creates a branch for a subtree that changed, it sends the
   subtree's split history. For a subtree that was never added through
   `git subtree`, that history shares nothing with the remote's other
   branches.
4. **Stacked branches compare with the base, not their parent.** A branch
   cut from `feature-1` (not from the base branch) counts everything
   `feature-1` changed as its own, unless you pass `--base feature-1`.
