# Scenario: not-connected

A remote is registered and its name matches an existing directory, but it
has never been fetched -- `refs/remotes/vendor/a/*` doesn't exist at all
yet.

- **Monorepo**: an empty `vendor/a` directory exists; `git remote add
  vendor/a <upstream>` has been run, but `git fetch` never has.
- **Remote**: has a `seed` commit, but we don't know that locally yet.

## Output

`scenario_not_connected` in [`setup.bash`](setup.bash)
builds this state. [How scenarios work](../README.md).
