# Scenario: diverged-unrelated-history

Both sides moved since the subtree was added, but the remote's entire history was
then replaced with something that shares no ancestry with what was last
synced -- e.g. the upstream repo was rebuilt from scratch.

- **Monorepo (`vendor/a`)**: added at `seed`, then one local commit
  under `vendor/a`.
- **Remote**: the original bare repo is deleted and recreated from
  scratch with a brand new, unrelated root commit.
- **Common ancestor**: **no**. `git merge-base` between the commit this
  tool last synced against (recorded in the `git-subtree-split:` trailer
  of the squash commit) and the remote's current tip finds nothing.

This is the case `git subtrees pull`/`push` must **not** try to
auto-merge: there's no principled three-way merge when two sides don't
share history, only a human decision to keep one side and discard the
other's. Both commands detect this and print two manual recovery command
sequences instead of attempting anything (see the output below).

Both sequences were verified by hand against this exact scenario shape
before being wired into `lib/common.sh`'s `print_unrelated_history_guidance`.

  git subtree add --prefix=vendor/a vendor/a main --squash

  # OR: accept the local (monorepo) version, overwriting vendor/a's history:
  git subtree split --prefix=vendor/a -b tmp-split-a

`push` refuses with the same message.
