# Scenario: diverged-then-pulled

Both sides changed different files, then the remote's change was pulled in.
The local change is still waiting to be pushed.

- **Monorepo (`vendor/a`)**: added at `seed`, then a local commit adding
  `local.txt`, then `git subtree pull --squash` of the upstream change. The
  merge has no conflict.
- **Remote**: `seed`, then a commit adding `upstream.txt`. It has never
  seen `local.txt`.

The pull moved the sync point to the remote's tip, but `vendor/a` still has
`local.txt` on top of it. Local changes must be measured against what the
sync point recorded from the remote, not against the merge commit that
brought it in: the merge commit already contains `local.txt`, which would
hide it from `push`.

## Output

The output below is real. `just docs-check` builds this state with
`scenario_diverged_then_pulled`,
the function in [`setup.bash`](setup.bash) that the bats tests call too,
and then runs each command.

<!--
```scrut {fail_fast: true, output_stream: combined}
$ source "$TESTDIR/../readme-setup.sh" && build_scenario scenario_diverged_then_pulled

`status` and `diff` show only `local.txt`, and `push` sends it:

```scrut
$ git subtrees status
ok   vendor/a -> $UPSTREAM (push)
 local.txt | 1 +
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
```

```scrut
$ git subtrees diff

```scrut

```scrut
