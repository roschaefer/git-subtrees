# Scenario: push-ahead

Local made a commit under the subtree path since it was added; the remote
hasn't moved.

- **Monorepo (`vendor/a`)**: added at `seed`, then one more local
  commit under `vendor/a`.
- **Remote**: still at `seed`, unchanged.
- **Common ancestor**: yes -- the add point (`seed`).

## Output

The output below is real. `just docs-check` builds this state with
`scenario_push_ahead`,
the function in [`setup.bash`](setup.bash) that the bats tests call too,
and then runs each command.
