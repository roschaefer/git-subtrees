usage: git subtrees init [--base <branch>] <path> <url>

One-time bootstrap adding/adopting worktree directory <path> from <url> as a
subtree, registering a remote named <path> if one doesn't already exist.
Requires exactly one <path> <url> pair -- unlike every other command, init
is not batchable across all discovered subtrees, since it's the one
operation that needs human judgment.

If the remote has no branch named like the current one (e.g. on a fresh
feature branch), init adds the remote's branch named like the monorepo's
base branch instead, so your first push creates the missing branch on top
of it. The base branch is taken from --base, else from origin/HEAD, else
from init.defaultBranch. If none resolves, or the remote lacks that branch
too (e.g. it's empty), init only registers the remote.
